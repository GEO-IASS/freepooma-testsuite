# Wrap make components from SHARED_ROOT and the current directory in the 
# proper order so that variables like ODIR have the correct directory-specific 
# value at the right moment.  See the included files for details of what they 
# are doing. This file should NOT be manually edited.

# Set NEXTDIR, THISDIR and DIR_LIST
include $(SHARED_ROOT)/include1.mk

# Include list of subdirectories to process
-include $(THISDIR)/subdir.mk

# Set list of object files, relative to ODIR
-include $(THISDIR)/objfile.mk

# Remove current dir from DIR_LIST
DIR_LIST :=$(filter-out $(firstword $(DIR_LIST)), $(DIR_LIST))
