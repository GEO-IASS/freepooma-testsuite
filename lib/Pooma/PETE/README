This directory contains some input files that are used to build the
operator definitions needed by Pooma to use PETE.  The file that get built are:
Array/ArrayOperators.h
Pooma/PoomaOperators.h
Pooma/VectorOperators.h

These files can be in this directory with the makefile and then you need
to move them to the appropriate locations.  To use the makefile, you need
to have PETE installed and set the environment variables PETEDIR which
points to the PETE installation and PETEARCHDIR which specifies the
architecture directory (sgi64 for example).
